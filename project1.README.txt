So the game is called catch the ball.

Basically the goal of the game is to make the multicolored square
collide with the objects that fly across the screen.
At the moment there is only one object that moves along the screen. So for difficulty,
the user most catch the ball before it hits the other side. To make things
even more difficult, there is a difficulty associated with your score. The speed of the 
object increases by 10% every 5 points. However, the render rate plays a larger role in 
the speed of the object than I would like. 

There are also buttons to let you start, pause, and stop the game. The only real difference
being that stop resets your score and draws another object. 

The game also keeps track of your high score. So there is no winning, just get the highest score
you can. 

It moves the objects using a translate function and model view matrices.
